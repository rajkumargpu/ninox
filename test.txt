1. Module & Schema Setup
In projects/api, generate a tasks module, controller, and service.
Define your TypeORM (or Prisma) models for tasks and task_logs, and write the initial migration.
2. RabbitMQ Configuration
Stand up a local (or AWS MQ) RabbitMQ instance.
In each service’s config, define the exchanges and queues:
task.created, status.updated, deadline.passed (fanout or topic exchange)
notification.email (direct queue with DLX + backoff)
3. API Endpoints
Implement POST /tasks:
Persist a new task in “Pending”, record a log entry, emit task.created.
Implement PATCH /tasks/:id/status:
Validate transitions, update status + log, emit status.updated.
Implement the three metrics endpoints (/tasks/:id/metrics, /tasks/metrics, /tasks/metrics/aggregate) with SQL queries or repository methods.
4. Coordinator Service
Subscribe to the three domain-event queues.
For each event type, map to the correct notification.email payload (and, later, SMS/Slack).
Instrument Prometheus counters/histograms around event handling and retries.
5. Email Worker
Listen on notification.email, call AWS SES (or SMTP), add retry/backoff logic via RabbitMQ DLX.
On permanent failure, emit alert.operations for your Ops channel.
6. Scheduler Worker
Implement a simple cron (via RabbitMQ-delayed messages or AWS EventBridge) that every 5 minutes:
Queries OracleDB for overdue “Pending”/“InProgress” tasks.
Emits deadline.passed for each.
7. Observability
Wire Pino in all services to your chosen log backend (CloudWatch, ELK, Datadog, etc.).
Expose a /metrics endpoint in API & Coordinator; configure Prometheus to scrape it.
Stand up Grafana (or use CloudWatch dashboards) to visualize:
Task creation rate, status-transition counts
Email send latency & retry rates
Deadline-breach alerts
8. Local Testing & E2E
Write unit tests for controllers and services.
Use a framework like Testcontainers to spin up RabbitMQ and OracleDB in CI.
Create an E2E script: “create task → simulate candidate actions → verify emails, logs, metrics.”
9. Docker & Deployment
Dockerize each NestJS service with a shared base image.
Define an ECS/EKS deployment (or use Docker Compose locally) that brings up API, Coordinator, Workers, RabbitMQ, and an OracleDB dev container.
Set up CI/CD to build images, run migrations, and deploy to AWS.
